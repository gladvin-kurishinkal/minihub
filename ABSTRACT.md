# Project Abstract: KTU Academic Hub

**Project Title:** KTU Academic Hub: An AI-Enhanced Cinematic Portal for Academic Management  
**Keywords:** AI Categorization, KTU Activity Points, Cinematic UI, Gemini 3 Flash, Academic Portal.

### **Problem Statement**
Students at APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU) often struggle with fragmented systems for tracking activity points, managing backlogs, and clearing fees. Manual categorization of certificates by faculty is inefficient. The KTU Academic Hub addresses these issues by providing a centralized, intelligent ecosystem.

### **Proposed Solution**
The platform integrates **Google Gemini 3 Flash** for automated activity classification and features a **Cinematic User Experience** built on a motion-first architecture. This dual approach reduces administrative overhead while providing a premium digital experience for students.

### **Implementation & Results**
Built with **React 19** and **Tailwind CSS**, the system features a Kinetic Authentication engine and dynamic dashboards. Testing indicates that AI-driven categorization significantly reduces the time required for students to log achievements and for faculty to verify them, ensuring a high-integrity academic record.
